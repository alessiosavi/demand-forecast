# Configuration

The [Settings schema](https://github.com/alessiosavi/demand-forecast/blob/main/demand_forecast/config/settings.py) is the source of
truth for current YAML fields and validation. Its top-level sections are `data`,
`forecast`, `model`, `training`, and `tuning`, with `seed`, `device`, and
`log_level`. `data` and `forecast` are required; other sections have defaults.

Start with the [tiny CPU example](https://github.com/alessiosavi/demand-forecast/blob/main/README.md#quick-start). Declare the ID
columns, target and `target_support` (`nonnegative` or `real`), then the forecast
horizon. Known-future, past-only and static columns have explicit roles. Paths
resolve from the working directory. The CLI takes output paths through `--out`
or `--out-dir`.

The [frozen protocol](protocol.md) defines the benchmark configuration and the
data, model, training and evaluation contracts.
`model.family: v2`, `training.refit: none`, and fev `--policy first_window` are
implemented. Full refitting, other model families, tuning and clustering integration are not implemented in the shared pipeline; the retained `tuning` schema does not enable them.

`models/wrapper.py`, `models/transformer.py`, `models/transformer_v2.py`,
`models/lightweight.py`, `core/tuning.py`, and `utils/clustering.py` remain on the
legacy contract and are not integrated into the shared pipeline. Old hackathon examples and their
`timeseries`/`output` sections do not describe the current `Settings` API.

Use the linked README, Settings schema and frozen protocol for current commands and contracts.
